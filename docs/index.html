        <h2>Client-Server Communication Protocol</h2>
        <p>
            The client and the server communicate through a TCP connection. The server listens on TCP port 4337 for
            unencrypted connections and 4338 for encrypted connections, which may be changed from the configuration. The
            client connects to the server and starts communicating. The client initiates the communication by selecting
            the protocol version. To decide on the protocol version, the client negotiates with the server.
        </p>

        <h3 id="proto-negotiation">Protocol version negotiation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The client starts by sending the protocol version in a single byte (ex: if the protocol version is 1,
                the client sends \x01). The version numbers can range from 1 to 253. The client should always send the
                highest protocol version it supports.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the server supports that version, it accepts the protocol version and acknowledges the client by
                responding with a single byte of value \x01, which denotes that the protocol is supported. It will end
                the protocol version negotiation phase. The client can now continue communicating using the selected
                protocol version.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the server does not support that protocol version, and if the requested protocol version is less than
                the lowest version the server is supporting, the server informs the client by responding with a single
                byte of value \x02, which denotes that the protocol is obsolete and not supported. It will be the end of
                the communication as there can be no compatible protocol versions between the client and the server
                since the highest protocol version supported by the client is less than the lowest version supported by
                the server. Therefore, this ends both the negotiation phase and the entire communication. Now, the
                client and the server will close the connection.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the server does not support that protocol version, and if the requested protocol version is higher
                than the highest version the server is supporting, the server informs the client by responding with a
                single byte of value \x03, which denotes that the protocol is unknown to the server and not supported.
                Then, the server sends the highest protocol version it can support in a single byte to the client to
                offer the chance to use that protocol version if the client supports it. Negotiation continues if the
                client accepts this protocol version.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the client supports the protocol version offered by the server, it will acknowledge that to the
                server by sending the accepted protocol version back to the server in a single byte. This protocol
                version is now accepted by both the server and the client. It will end the protocol version negotiation
                phase. The client can now continue communicating using the selected protocol version.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the client does not support the offered protocol version, it rejects the offer by replying to the
                server with a single byte \x00. It implies that there can be no compatible protocol versions between the
                server and the client. Therefore, this ends both the negotiation phase and the entire communication.
                Now, the client and the server will close the connection.
            </li>
        </ul>
